			<p> interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed, co-written and co-produced by Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity.</br> <a href="#link"> GOTO LINK </a>



In the mid-21st century, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Corn is the last viable crop. The world has also regressed into a post-truth society where younger generations are taught ideas such as the Apollo moon missions were faked. Widowed engineer and former NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer. Living with him are his father-in-law, Donald; his 15-year-old son, Tom; and 10-year-old daughter, Murphy. After a dust storm, strange patterns made from dust inexplicably appear on Murphy's bedroom floor, she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Cooper eventually deduces the patterns were caused by gravity variations and are a binary code for geographic coordinates. Cooper follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, Cooper's former supervisor. Professor Brand says gravitational anomalies have happened elsewhere. 48 years earlier, unknown beings positioned a wormhole near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a black hole named Gargantua. Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets. Astronauts Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived two plans to ensure humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel a mass exodus, while Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft carrying 5,000 frozen human embryos to colonize a habitable planet.</br>




Cooper is recruited to pilot the Endurance. The crew includes scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Dr. Romilly, Dr. Doyle, and robots TARS and CASE. Before leaving, Cooper gives a distraught Murphy his wristwatch to compare their relative time for when he returns. After traversing the wormhole, Romilly studies the black hole while Cooper, Doyle, and Brand descend in a landing craft to investigate Miller's planet, an ocean world. After finding wreckage from Miller's ship, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and delays the lander's departure. Due to the proximity of the black hole, time is severely dilated. As a result, 23 years have elapsed for Romilly on Endurance by the time Cooper and Brand return. </br>



		Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta (Canada), Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.</br> 

Edmunds' planet has slightly better telemetry, while Mann broadcasts positive data. Cooper rules to use their remaining fuel to reach Mann's planet. On Mann's planet, the Endurance crew revive him from cryostasis. Meanwhile, Murphy, now a scientist, has transmitted a message announcing Professor Brand has died. She has learned that Plan A, requiring unattainable data from within a black hole, was never viable. Plan B was always Professor Brand's only option. Murphy accuses Amelia and Cooper of knowing those left on Earth were doomed. Mann's frozen planet is uninhabitable; he sent falsified data in order to be rescued. Mann attempts to murder Cooper, then escapes in a lander and heads for Endurance. Romilly is killed by Mann's booby trap and Amelia and Cooper race to the Endurance in another lander. Mann dies during a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging Endurance. After a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control of Endurance.</br>

With insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds' planet, they use a slingshot maneuver so close to Gargantua that time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison themselves to shed weight and ensure Endurance reaches Edmunds' planet. Slipping through the event horizon of Gargantua, they eject from their respective craft and find themselves inside a massive tesseract, possibly constructed by future humans. Across different time periods, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Cooper realizes he was Murphy's "ghost" and manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her, using Morse Code to transmit the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon. Cooper and TARS are ejected from the tesseract. Cooper awakens on a space habitat orbiting Saturn, where he reunites with an elderly Murphy. Using the quantum data sent by Cooper, the younger Murphy solved the gravitational propulsion theory for Plan A, enabling humanity's exodus and survival. Nearing death and with her own family, Murphy urges Cooper to return to Amelia. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Amelia and CASE on Edmunds' habitable planet.</br>
The premise for Interstellar was conceived by producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date.[4][5] The two conceived of a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about "the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans," and attracted filmmaker Steven Spielberg's interest in directing.[6] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce.[7][8] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[9]

After Spielberg moved his production studio DreamWorks from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[10] Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.[11] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar.[12] Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight,[13] and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[14] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions.[15] The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross.[16] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.[11]

Warner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan's production of Interstellar from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the TV series South Park. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate "A-list" property.[17] In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film's production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forego financing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) in exchange for the stake in Interstellar.
